            <div class="article-content">
                <p>As we approach 2025, the landscape of web development continues to evolve at a rapid pace. In this article, we'll explore the cutting-edge technologies and methodologies that are set to shape the future of web development.</p>
                
                <h2>1. AI-Driven Design and Development</h2>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing how we approach web design and development. AI-powered tools are now capable of generating entire layouts, suggesting design improvements, and even writing basic code. This trend is expected to accelerate, with AI becoming an indispensable assistant to web developers.</p>
                
                <h2>2. WebAssembly and the Rise of Browser-Based Applications</h2>
                <p>WebAssembly (Wasm) is enabling high-performance applications to run directly in the browser. By 2025, we expect to see more complex, desktop-quality applications running on the web, blurring the line between web and native apps.</p>
                
                <h2>3. The Maturation of Serverless Architecture</h2>
                <p>Serverless computing is gaining momentum, allowing developers to build and run applications without thinking about servers. This trend will continue to grow, simplifying deployment and scaling processes for web applications.</p>
                
                <h2>4. Extended Reality (XR) on the Web</h2>
                <p>With advancements in WebXR, we're seeing more augmented and virtual reality experiences delivered through web browsers. By 2025, XR is expected to become a more common feature in web applications, especially in e-commerce and education sectors.</p>
                
                <h2>5. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) Become the Norm</h2>
                <p>PWAs have been around for a while, but by 2025, they're expected to become the standard approach for web application development, offering app-like experiences with the reach and accessibility of the web.</p>
                
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The future of web development is exciting and full of possibilities. As we move towards 2025, developers will need to stay adaptable and continue learning to keep up with these emerging trends. The web of the future will be more powerful, more accessible, and more integrated into our daily lives than ever before.</p>
